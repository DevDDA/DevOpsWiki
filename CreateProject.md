Once selected a side dialogue will appear. Enter the name of the project (required). Enter a brief description, even though this is optional, to give an indication to other team members as to the nature of the project.

<br>

> ### **Note:**
>  - Always make sure that the Visibility of the project is set to 'Private' and that the 'Version control' is set to Git. Using Git allows for easier future migration to other platforms if required.
>  - Also the 'Work item process' can be set to one of five processes. By default this is set to ['Basic'](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/boards/work-items/guidance/choose-process?view=azure-devops&tabs=basic-process#basic-agile-scrum-and-cmmi) as most projects we develop do not need the added functionality provided by other processes.
