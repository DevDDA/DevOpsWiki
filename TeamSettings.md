By default the person who created the project becomes the project administrator. In order for complete support of the project you will need to add the rest of the development team to its team membership. This is done by using the ***DevOps Developers*** group. There are a couple of ways to do this but this page will describe one.

> You need to be in the project that you are setting the permissions for and also be the project administrator.

Click on the 'Project settings' at the bottom of the left-hand menu

Next select 'Permissions' from the left-hand menu under the 'General' group

This will show the following, similar, view. Select 'The default project team' that will have the title of your project.

Select the 'Members' tab then click on the 'Add' button to the right.

Add the 'DevOp Developers' group and select the 'Save' button at the bottom of the view.

Going back to the projects summary page will show that the membership has been updated and every developer on the team has the correct access.
