Azure DevOps Services is the current choice of version control for applications developed by the CDIO CSG AST. It provides all the tools and functionality required by this team currently in order to maintain a centralised collaborative cloud based environment, and is code language agnostic.

It has many advantages over the old methods employed by development teams in the past and, unfortunately, are still being currently used. Saving different versions of the same project on a file-share is problematic and wasteful of storage resources. Also storing projects on your personal development machine is pointless and a risk.

The use of Azure DevOps Services is straight forward, in the creation of a project, but has many processes that need to be understood and followed.

This wiki hopes to provide some guidance we all should follow and will cover the following:
